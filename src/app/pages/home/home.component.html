      Ask the prompt below what type of project you would like to co-work on with your friends - 
      and a gpt-api collects and returns these parameters to you a list of 4 possible projects. 
      You can then select a total of 2 ideas from this and send to your friends.

      The goal of this application is co-creation for raising your attraction to future employers and brush off teamworking skills (and what do you know maybe some good friends too?) or if you just have common idea drought. 
      <br><br>They can then reply what project sounds most interesting - and you can choose platform and start co-creating!
