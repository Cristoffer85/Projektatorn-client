## Usage
Main use is for brainstorming ideas on what projects you - together with your friends can use to make programming ideas - mainly by cooperating together and dusting off teamworking skills, which is a highly good skill working in a company where you are very rarely alone (and also same applies for the rest of the world)   

You can never solve all problems alone hence why teamwork is the dreamwork!
